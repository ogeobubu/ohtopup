          you've earned and redeemed), and the option to redeem the gift points
          for cash.

          At the moment, 10 gift points = 1 Naira equivalent. Meaning, if you
          have 20,000 gift points, you can redeem it for 2,000 Naira to your
          Naira wallet.

          Thereâ€™s a minimum amount of gift points you can redeem. You will see
          this on the gift points redemption page. This means, if the minimum
          redeemable gift points amount is 10,000, you won't be able to redeem
          less than 10,000 at a time.
